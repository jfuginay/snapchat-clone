# 🚀 iOS Upload Fix Guide - Version Conflict Resolution

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

**Error**: "The bundle version must be higher than the previously uploaded version: '10'"

**Root Cause**: You tried to upload the same build number (10) that was already uploaded to App Store Connect.

## ✅ **Solution In Progress**

I've started a new build with incremented version:
- **Previous Build**: Version 1.3.0 (Build 10) 
- **New Build**: Version 1.3.0 (Build 11) ← Currently building

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Upload Process**

**Monitor Progress:**

### Step 2: Submit New Build to TestFlight
Once the new build completes:

```bash

This will automatically select the latest build (build 11).
