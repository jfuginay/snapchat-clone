## 🎯 **RAG System Explanation**

### **What Makes This Special:**
The tutorial dedicates **2 full steps** to explaining our RAG system - this is what differentiates TribeFind from other social apps!

### **Step 6: AI-Powered RAG System**
```
🧠 How RAG Works:
• Analyzes your location, interests, and social context
• Provides intelligent recommendations  
• Understands your tribe preferences
• Suggests activities and meetups
• Learns from your interactions

Example: "What should I do tonight?" → AI considers your location, 
interests, friends nearby, weather, and time to give personalized suggestions!
```

### **Step 7: RAG in Action**
```
🎯 Smart Scenarios:
• "Find coffee shops my friends visited"
• "What activities are popular nearby?"
• "Recommend places for photography"
• "Who shares my hiking interests?"

The AI combines your location, social graph, interests, and real-time 
data to give you perfect recommendations!
```
