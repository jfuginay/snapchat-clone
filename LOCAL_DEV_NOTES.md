# Development Tooling (Local Only)

These files are for development assistance and stay local:

## Claude CLI
- Installed globally: `claude-code` command available in terminal
- Task Master AI: `task-master` command for project management
- Does NOT affect the app code

## Local Development Files
- .cursor/ - Cursor IDE rules and MCP config
- .taskmaster/ - Task Master project management
- .windsurf/ - Windsurf IDE rules  
- CLAUDE.md - Claude CLI documentation

## Separation Complete
✅ App features: Committed to feature/ai-chat-subscription-system
✅ Dev tooling: Stays local only
✅ No mixing of concerns
