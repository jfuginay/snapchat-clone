## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Common Issues:**

**Development Build Required:**
- Video features require native code
- Cannot run in Expo Go - must use development build
- Run `eas build --platform ios --profile development`

**Permissions Not Granted:**
- Camera permission required for video recording
- Microphone permission required for audio
- Media library permission for saving videos

**Video Not Recording:**
- Check camera device availability
- Ensure proper permissions granted
- Verify react-native-vision-camera installation
- Check development build includes native modules

**Upload Failures:**
- Verify Supabase videos bucket exists
- Check internet connection for cloud upload
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Run video-database-setup.sql if tables missing

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check native module installation
npx expo install --check

# Rebuild development build
eas build --platform ios --profile development --clear-cache

# Check app.json plugin configuration
cat app.json | grep -A 10 "react-native-vision-camera"
```
