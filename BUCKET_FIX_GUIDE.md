# üö® Fix Image Loading - Bucket Configuration Issue

## The Problem
Photos are uploading successfully but showing as gray placeholders because the storage bucket isn't properly configured for public access.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Storage Settings
1. Go to your [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com)
2. Select your **snapchat-clone** project
3. Go to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click on the **"photos"** bucket

### Step 2: Make Bucket Public
1. Click the **"‚öôÔ∏è Settings"** button (gear icon) next to the photos bucket
2. Toggle **"Public bucket"** to **ON** ‚úÖ
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Verify Bucket Policies  
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. Make sure you have these policies for the **photos** bucket:

**Required Policies:**
- ‚úÖ **SELECT**: "Anyone can view photos" (for `authenticated` and `anon` users)
- ‚úÖ **INSERT**: "Users can upload own photos" (for `authenticated` users)
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE**: "Users can update own photos" (for `authenticated` users)  
- ‚úÖ **DELETE**: "Users can delete own photos" (for `authenticated` users)

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Go back to your app
2. **Refresh** the home screen (pull down to refresh or tap the refresh icon)
3. Images should now display properly! üéâ

## Alternative: Restart Everything
If images still don't show:
1. **Close the Expo app completely** on your phone
2. **Restart Expo server**: `Ctrl+C` then `npm start` 
3. **Reopen the app** and check again

## What This Does
Making the bucket public allows:
- ‚úÖ Direct image URL access without authentication
- ‚úÖ Faster image loading
- ‚úÖ Proper image display in the gallery
- ‚úÖ Image sharing capabilities

## Still Having Issues?
Check the console logs for:
- "Bucket access error" - indicates permission issues
- "URL accessibility test: 200 true" - means images should work
- "Test signed URL" - backup method if public URLs fail

The signed URL approach should work even if the bucket isn't public, so you should see images either way after these fixes.
