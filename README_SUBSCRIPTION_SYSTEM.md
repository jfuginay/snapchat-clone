### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
interface SubscriptionState {
  currentPlan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'premium';
  billingCycle: 'monthly' | 'yearly';
  usage: {
    dailyMessages: number;
    lastResetDate: string;
  };
  showUpgradePrompt: boolean;
}
```

### Subscription Plans Configuration
```typescript
const SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS = {
  free: {
    id: 'free',
    name: 'Free',
    price: 'Free',
    color: '#6B7280',
    limits: { dailyAIMessages: 10, responseQuality: 'Basic' },
    features: ['10 daily AI messages', 'Basic responses', 'Community support']
  },
  pro: {
    id: 'pro', 
    name: 'Pro',
    price: '$4.99',
    color: '#3B82F6',
    limits: { dailyAIMessages: 100, responseQuality: 'Enhanced' },
    features: ['100 daily AI messages', 'Enhanced AI responses', 'Priority support']
  },
  premium: {
    id: 'premium',
    name: 'Premium', 
    price: '$9.99',
