# 🔧 Network Error Fix Guide

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- ✅ Created `.env` file with proper Supabase credentials
- ✅ Updated `lib/supabase.ts` to use environment variables

- ✅ Added connection testing before authentication attempts
- ✅ Better error reporting for troubleshooting

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### 1. **Database Setup** (CRITICAL)
You need to set up the database tables in Supabase:

```sql
-- Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of database-setup.sql
-- Click "Run" to create all tables
```

### 2. **Test the App**
1. **Restart Expo Go** on your iPhone (close and reopen the app)
2. **Scan the QR code** again from the terminal
3. **Try signing up** with a new account

### 3. **Verify Supabase Setup**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
2. Find your project: `hvjqvyozpczekwwizxzj`
3. Check that the `users` table exists in **Database → Tables**
4. If no tables exist, run the SQL from `database-setup.sql`

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### Network Error Solutions:
1. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure your iPhone and computer are on the same network
2. **Firewall**: Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection
3. **Supabase Status**: Check if Supabase is experiencing issues
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify the `.env` file exists and has correct values

### Database Connection Issues:
```typescript
// Test Supabase connection in the app
const { testConnection } = useAuth()
const isConnected = await testConnection()
console.log('Connection status:', isConnected)
```

### Common Fixes:
- Restart Expo Go app completely
- Make sure you're on the same WiFi network
- Check Supabase project is active
- Verify API keys are correct

## 📱 **Expected Behavior:**

After these fixes, you should be able to:
- ✅ Load the app without network errors
- ✅ See the authentication screen
- ✅ Create a new account successfully
- ✅ Navigate between tabs
- ✅ Access profile and settings

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Check logs** in Expo Go for more specific error messages
2. **Verify Supabase project** is active and accessible
3. **Run connection test** from the app
4. **Check network connectivity** between devices

The app should now work properly with real database integration! 🎉
