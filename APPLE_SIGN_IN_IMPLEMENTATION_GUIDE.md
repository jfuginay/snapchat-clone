# Apple Sign In Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the implementation of Apple Sign In for TribeFind to comply with Apple's App Store guidelines, specifically **Guideline 4.8 - Design - Login Services**. Apple Sign In has been integrated as an equivalent login option that meets all the required features:

- ✅ Limits data collection to user's name and email address
- ✅ Allows users to keep their email address private (Hide My Email feature)
- ✅ Does not collect interactions with the app for advertising purposes without consent

## Implementation Details

```bash
npm install expo-apple-authentication
```

### 2. Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `services/AppleSignInService.ts` - Apple Sign In service implementation
