# Google Authentication Fix - Testing Guide 🔧

## Problem Fixed
- ❌ Before: Demo Google accounts being created in TestFlight/Production
- ❌ Before: Duplicate key errors from fake demo users  
- ❌ Before: Google Sign-In not working in production builds

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ After: Environment detection prevents demo mode in production
- ✅ After: Real Google authentication in TestFlight/Production
- ✅ After: Demo mode only works in Expo Go for development

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Local Testing (Expo Go)
`npm start` → Open in Expo Go → Test Google Sign-In
Expected: Demo mode with fake user

### 2. Production Testing (TestFlight)  
`eas build` → Install via TestFlight → Test Google Sign-In
Expected: Real Google authentication

### 3. Environment Detection
Look for logs showing environment detection and production vs demo mode

## ✅ Expected Results
- Expo Go: Demo mode works for testing
- TestFlight/Production: Real Google authentication
- No more duplicate key errors
