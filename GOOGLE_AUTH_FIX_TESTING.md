# 🔧 Google Authentication - Real Auth Only

## Problem Fixed
- ❌ Before: Demo Google accounts being created in TestFlight/Production
- ❌ Before: Duplicate key errors from fake demo users  
- ❌ Before: Google Sign-In not working in production builds

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ After: Real Google authentication in all environments (Expo Go, TestFlight, Production)
- ✅ After: No more demo mode or fake users
- ✅ After: Consistent real authentication flow everywhere

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Local Testing (Expo Go)
`npm start` → Open in Expo Go → Test Google Sign-In
Expected: Real Google authentication (no demo mode)

### 2. Production Testing (TestFlight)  
`eas build` → Install via TestFlight → Test Google Sign-In
Expected: Real Google authentication

### 3. Environment Detection
Look for logs showing real Google authentication in all environments

## ✅ Expected Results
- All environments: Real Google authentication only
- No more demo mode or fake users
- No more duplicate key errors
- Consistent behavior in development and production
